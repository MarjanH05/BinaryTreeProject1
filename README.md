# BinaryTreeProject1
Binary Tree Project adhering to a series of guidelines

There are many different versions of the BinaryTree:

To use the command Line you must set the path to the location of the exe file.
Easiest way is using cd "..BinaryTreeProject1\{platform}\{configuration} 

Using the tests select the solution and go to properties.
Then, the single start up project should be set to BinaryTreeTests and click apply
Hopefully that is a 100% working test!

There are 2 GUI version, I'd reccomend using the BinaryTreeGUIOWl but both work. Simply make them the startup project. 

Finally the installer. Click on BinaryTreeInstaller and press build. This will generate an install in the folder 'installs'. This create a machine - install application.
